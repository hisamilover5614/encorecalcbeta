The_Eevee_Man's Extended Calculator
=======================

Damage Calculator for Touhou Puppet Dance Performance - Shard of Dreams -Extended-.

This is NOT the official repository for the Pokemon Showdown damage calculator.
However, it uses said calculator as a base. As a result, it has essentially the same features.
You may find the original here: https://github.com/Zarel/honko-damagecalc

Most of the framework of this calculator was done by Choon - I only added -Extended- elements 
not present within the base calculator, as well as fixing a few minor bugs.

Instructions
